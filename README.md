# C# 101

### Task 1

- Install the C# extension in Visual Studio Code.
- Clone down the repo above if you haven't done so already!
- Navigate to the correct folder in the terminal.

### Task 2

- Open Program.cs in 'Hello World'.
- Change the Console.WriteLine to print something other than "Hello World!" and run the application to make sure it works.

### Task 3

- Open Program.cs in 'If Statement'.
- Create a variable called 'firstNumber' that has a value of 10.
- Create a second variable called 'secondNumber' that has a value of 20.
- Write an if statement that compares the two variables and prints which one is bigger using Console.WriteLine.

### Task 4

- Open Program.cs in 'Using And'.
- Create a variable called 'number1' that has a value of 7.5.
- Create a second variable called 'number2' that has a value of 9.5.
- Write an if statement that prints out "True" if 'number1' is greater than 'number2' AND 'they add up to 20 or more.
- If either of these statements is false then it should print 'False'.

### Task 5

- Open Program.cs in 'While Loop'.
- Create a variable called 'counter' that has a value of 0.
- Create a while loop that will run while 'counter' is less than 15.
- Finally the while loop should add 1 onto 'counter'.
- For each of the iterations, the application should print out "The counter is" and then the number.

### Task 6

- Open Program.cs in 'For Loop'.
- Create a 'for' loop that loops up to 25.
- For each of the iterations, print out "The integer is" and then the number.
- Now try the same thing for the letters from A to M underneath.

### Task 7

- Open Program.cs in 'Challenge'.
- Add a variable called 'sum' that is equal to 0.
- Create a 'for' loop that iterates through numbers 1 to 100.
- For each of the iterations, if the number is divisible by 3, add it to the 'sum' total.
- Print out the value of 'sum'.
